Transform bedtime for your toddlers with our app! As a parent, I understand the bedtime challenge, which is why I created this app to make it easier for all of us. Use your phone as a reading light during story time and a nightlight for bedtime. What sets our app apart is its gradual screen dimming, ensuring a smooth transition from reading to sleep.

Here's why you'll love our app:

- Gradual dimming with adjustable speed, controlled by user-friendly buttons and speed indicators.
- Say goodbye to abrupt lighting changes with our gradual shift from white light to red light, preserving night vision.
- Plan your evening effectively with the estimated lights-out time.
- No need to worry about turning off the backlight â€“ it automatically goes off after the dimming cycle finishes.
- Enjoy a seven-day free preview mode to experience all these benefits.

We've designed this app with parents like you in mind, so you can focus on your child, not the lighting. Say hello to reduced-stress bedtimes with our app!

Coming soon to the Apple App Store!
