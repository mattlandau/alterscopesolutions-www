The iSwear Jar app gives you the power to create or eliminate any habit. Unlike ordinary habit trackers, there’s a real financial penalty for not following through. If you honestly intend to change, the penalty for each slip-up is a voluntary in-app purchase. It’s a swear jar for any habit!

Easy choices might cost nothing, and even big improvements can be surprisingly cheap. This app gives you a surprisingly useful way to throw money away, allowing you to gain ownership of your choices in the process. Features that will help you succeed include:

- Create a promise to yourself
- Add unlimited swear jars
- Track progress with money spent
- Earn a symbolic gold star icon with every success
- Feel financially motivated to avoid slipping up!

Now available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iswear-jar/id1633852599)!
