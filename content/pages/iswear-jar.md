The iSwear Jar gives you the power to create or destroy any habit. Simply imagine a dollar bill being thinly sliced by a paper shredder, turning cool cash into green slivers... Then imagine that dollar bill was yours, and that you surrendered it as a penalty for slipping up. This technique of using a freely made decision to bind oneself in the future is called a Ulysses Pact, and dates back to the Odyssey. It can be used to effect great change.

This app gives you the opportunity to use this technique. Based on the honor system, you can make a voluntary in-app purchase for your slip ups and missed goals.

Features include:

- Accountability on the go
- Complete privacy
- Acknowledge your slip ups with a real monetary commitment
- Celebrate your successes with an iconic gold star
