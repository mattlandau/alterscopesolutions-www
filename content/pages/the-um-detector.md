Do you want to improve your speaking? Do find yourself yourself overusing filler words? This app will help you break the habit and speak more confidently.

The Um Detector listens for when you say any these words and/or phrases: “um,” “like,” and “you know.” When it detects a filler word being used, the word will flash red, and optionally, your device will vibrate.

The free version of this app allows you to use it for 5 minutes per day.

Available now on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-um-detector/id1566958588)!
