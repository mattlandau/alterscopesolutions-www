Alterscope Solutions was founded by Matt in 2021 to bring new ideas to life and to try to improve the daily lives of a large number of people. I'm a full time sysadmin with app development as my side hustle. I really do enjoy writing code and bringing ideas to life, or else I wouldn't be writing this at 11pm.

If you have an idea for an app that maybe you'd like to share, please let me know on the [contact form](/support).

In the meantime, feel free to connect on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mattlandaumlis)
