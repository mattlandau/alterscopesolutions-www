Experience the world in a whole new way with Proximity Sense AR!

Our innovative app uses augmented reality technology to sense the distance to objects around you and translate that information into a pattern of vibrations. Simply point your phone in front of you and let the vibrations guide you. The closer you get to an object, the more intense the vibrations become.

Proximity Sense AR is perfect for exploring an environment by touch alone, and if your device has a LIDAR sensor, it can even be used to navigate in the dark. Itâ€™s also a great tool for experiencing your surroundings in a unique and intuitive way.

So why wait? Download Proximity Sense AR today and start exploring the world around you in a whole new way!

Note, for technical reference, the vibration frequency scales down from 100 Hz to the inverse of the third power of the distance out to 4 meters, intensity is proportional to rate of change of distance, and vertical surfaces (e.g. walls) have a 4 Hz pattern overlaid on the main pattern in order to provide category information.

Now available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/proximity-sense-ar/id1662224416)!
