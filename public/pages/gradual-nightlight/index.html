<p>Transform bedtime for your toddlers with our app! As a parent, I understand the bedtime challenge, which is why I created this app to make it easier for all of us. Use your phone as a reading light during story time and a nightlight for bedtime. What sets our app apart is its gradual screen dimming, ensuring a smooth transition from reading to sleep.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll love our app:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gradual dimming with adjustable speed, controlled by user-friendly buttons and speed indicators.</li>
<li>Say goodbye to abrupt lighting changes with our gradual shift from white light to red light, preserving night vision.</li>
<li>Plan your evening effectively with the estimated lights-out time.</li>
<li>No need to worry about turning off the backlight â€“ it automatically goes off after the dimming cycle finishes.</li>
<li>Enjoy a seven-day free preview mode to experience all these benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve designed this app with parents like you in mind, so you can focus on your child, not the lighting. Say hello to reduced-stress bedtimes with our app!</p>
