      <description>Experience the world in a whole new way with Proximity Sense AR!
Our innovative app uses augmented reality technology to sense the distance to objects around you and translate that information into a pattern of vibrations. Simply point your phone in front of you and let the vibrations guide you. The closer you get to an object, the more intense the vibrations become.
Proximity Sense AR is perfect for exploring an environment by touch alone, and if your device has a LIDAR sensor, it can even be used to navigate in the dark.</description>
